### Workshop DB setup
Execute the following command to run the container with new DB:

docker run --name mysql_workshop -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=%  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mysql_workshop -d mysql/mysql-server

This will create a docker container running a mysql db named "mysql_workshop".

Let's connect to the DB using mysql workbench.

Create new connection in mysql workbench, configure and test your connection:

Download [workshop_instert_data.sql](https://github.com/monday-u-com/workshop-9/blob/main/workshop_instert_data.sql) and execute it in workbench. This will insert data to the tables in our DB.
